**Blanketing invention**

- Use of four old blankets in peak winters in Dehradun without use of proper/heavy quilt. 
- Solves the need or requirement of proper thick quilt in thick winters. 
- Innovative process of laying blankets: 
    - _First layer_: Rough blanket folded at end of bed to prevent air flow at side of legs. Top layer of this blanket begins at the knees. Bottom layer after the fold will be under the lying person. 
    - _Second layer_: Soft blanket on top of first blanket shall begin its top cover length where face of person will be covered along with rest of the body. At the end of bed blanket will again be folded and remain under the bottom layer of first blanket. This layer will also be under the body. Its top layer is covering the body and bottom layer is under the body. 
    - _Third layer_: Soft blanket (not too warm, less width) again started to be laid from where knees of person will lie on bed. This is top layer. Bottom layer will be folded (more in length at bottom than bottom layer of second blanket) and will reach about half of bed underneath second blanket. 
    - _Fourth layer_: Same as Second layer. Use of soft blanket that will be covering body from face to toes unlike the first and third layers of blackets that start covering body from the knees. 
- This alternative folding of less length (2, 4) under the body and more (1, 3), helps blankets from not slipping or changing their positions of folds at night. Blankets remain as is throughout the night. 
- Perfect solution for winters. Good for people who are not having quilts. No cold. Proper heat maintained inside blankets.
