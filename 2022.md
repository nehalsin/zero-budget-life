**Important update on food!** 

- Amlas, Sprouts in food. This is third time properly Amlas being brought and made in house. Now this will be continuous process it seems. Earlier two iterations were more about pickling and making jam (jam was successful second time with grated ginger) which were mostly shared with friends and family. In second iteration some was saved for us. Third time all 81 Amlas were made twice, using a simple technique of making special _tadka_ ([recipe here](https://nehalsin.github.io/cooking/2022.html)). 
- Lot of Pahadi Karelas (also called Ram Karela, see Insights section [here](https://nehalsin.github.io/cooking/2022.html)) with Ridge Gourds (total about 7 kg) costed 60/-. Being made daily since 2022-11-02. Made in different ways. Ripened seeds of Karelas collected for gifting. 
    - Selection of ripening vegetables then those cooked first. 
    - Selection done every day. 
    - Waste also generated. Waste food for composting. 
    - No waste in ridge gourd. These were amongst those which none was purchasing. However all ridge gourds turned out to be perfect. 
- Squash (one more new vegetable) bought yesterday. Gifted for sowing as is.
- Amlas being eaten every day. Cooked twice after total 81 brought from friend's place. About 10 thrown as they got spoiled. Rest all cooked today. Amlas turning out to be great recipe these days! _Standardization in cooking happens. And you learn how to cook something best in your own way!_
